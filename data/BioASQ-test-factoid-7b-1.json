Although aberrant reactivation of embryonic gene programs is intricately linked to pathological heart disease, the transcription factors driving these gene programs remain ill-defined. Here we report that increased calcineurin/Nfat signalling and decreased miR-25 expression integrate to re-express the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor dHAND (also known as Hand2) in the diseased human and mouse myocardium. In line, mutant mice overexpressing Hand2 in otherwise healthy heart muscle cells developed a phenotype of pathological hypertrophy. Conversely, conditional gene-targeted Hand2 mice demonstrated a marked resistance to pressure-overload-induced hypertrophy, fibrosis, ventricular dysfunction and induction of a fetal gene program. Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of miR-25 by a specific antagomir evoked spontaneous cardiac dysfunction and sensitized the murine myocardium to heart failure in a Hand2-dependent manner. Our results reveal that signalling cascades integrate with microRNAs to induce the expression of the bHLH transcription factor Hand2 in the postnatal mammalian myocardium with impact on embryonic gene programs in heart failure.",

Mobile genetic elements with the ability to integrate genetic information into chromosomes can cause disease over short periods of time and shape genomes over eons. These elements can be used for functional genomics, gene transfer and human gene therapy. However, their integration-site preferences, which are critically important for these uses, are poorly understood. We analyzed the insertion sites of several transposons and retroviruses to detect patterns of integration that might be useful for prediction of preferred integration sites. Initially we found that a mathematical description of DNA-deformability, called V(step), could be used to distinguish preferential integration sites for Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons into a particular 100 bp region of a plasmid [G. Liu, A. M. Geurts, K. Yae, A. R. Srinivassan, S. C. Fahrenkrug, D. A. Largaespada,J. Takeda, K. Horie, W. K. Olson and P. B. Hackett (2005) J. Mol. Biol., 346, 161-173 ]. Based on these findings, we extended our examination of integration of SB transposons into whole plasmids and chromosomal DNA. To accommodate sequences up to 3 Mb for these analyses, we developed an automated method, ProTIS, that can generate profiles of predicted integration events. However, a similar approach did not reveal any structural pattern of DNA that could be used to predict favored integration sites for other transposons as well as retroviruses and lentiviruses due to a limitation of available data sets. Nonetheless, ProTIS has the utility for predicting likely SB transposon integration sites in investigator-selected regions of genomes and our general strategy may be useful for other mobile elements once a sufficiently high density of sites in a single region are obtained. ProTIS analysis can be useful for functional genomic, gene transfer and human gene therapy applications using the SB system.",

The persistent intrastock polymorphism detected is largely amenable to insertion/excision equilibria at 36 genomic sites that form a gradient in occupancy. In a closely related stock, Bari 1 elements are stable and exhibit a substantially different genomic distribution.

BACKGROUND: Among the Solanaceae plants, the pepper genome is three times larger than that of tomato. Although the gene repertoire and gene order of both species are well conserved, the cause of the genome-size difference is not known. To determine the causes for the expansion of pepper euchromatic regions, we compared the pepper genome to that of tomato. RESULTS: For sequence-level analysis, we generated 35.6 Mb of pepper genomic sequences from euchromatin enriched 1,245 pepper BAC clones. The comparative analysis of orthologous gene-rich regions between both species revealed insertion of transposons exclusively in the pepper sequences, maintaining the gene order and content. The most common type of the transposon found was the LTR retrotransposon. Phylogenetic comparison of the LTR retrotransposons revealed that two groups of Ty3/Gypsy-like elements (Tat and Athila) were overly accumulated in the pepper genome. The FISH analysis of the pepper Tat elements showed a random distribution in heterochromatic and euchromatic regions, whereas the tomato Tat elements showed heterochromatin-preferential accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to tomato pepper euchromatin doubled its size by differential accumulation of a specific group of Ty3/Gypsy-like elements.

The FB transposons have been rarely reported in plants; RYS1 is the first described in rye and also the first active plant FB transposon reported. Preferential integration points in the rye genome exist, because the new insertions seem to be located, in all studied cases, in the same genome positions. We assume that RYS1 became active in rye very recently, as different plants from in vivo-growing cultivars showed that these elements were present or absent in the same genomic position in which the in vitro-activated element was found. This high rate of modification in these particular loci, both in the in vivo and in vitro populations, could indicate that probably the mechanisms promoting genetic variability in nature are the same that induce variation in vitro, and the modifications induced by somaclonal variation could be already present in vivo populations.",

The availability of completely sequenced genomes has created an opportunity for high throughput mutational studies. Using the conjugative transposon Tn916, a pilot project was initiated to determine the efficiency of gene disruption in the first completely sequenced bacterium, Haemophilus influenzae Rd strain KW20. DNA was isolated from Tn916-mutagenized cells, and the point of transposon insertion was determined by inverse PCR, DNA sequencing, and mapping to the wild-type genome sequence. Analysis of the insertion sites at the nucleotide level demonstrated a biased pattern of insertion into regions rich in stretches of A's and T's. Although Tn916 integrated at multiple dispersed positions throughout the chromosome, 9 of 10 insertion events occurred in noncoding, intergenic DNA. It was determined that the intergenic DNA was over 5% more A + T-rich than that of protein coding sequences. This suggests that A + T-rich sequences similar to the Tn916 insertion site would be more likely to reside in the intergenic DNA. In an effort to identify other likely sites for transposon integration, a hidden Markov model of the consensus target insertion site was derived from the Tn916-H. influenzae junction fragments and searched against the entire genome. Eighty percent of the 30 highest-scoring predicted Tn916 target sites were from intergenic, nonprotein-coding regions of the genome. These data support the hypothesis that Tn916 has a marked preference for insertion into noncoding DNA for H. influenzae, suggesting that this mobile element has evolved to minimize disruption of host cell function on integration.",

DNA transposons and retroviruses are important transgenic tools for genome engineering. An important consideration affecting the choice of transgenic vector is their insertion site preferences. Previous large-scale analyses of Ds transposon integration sites in plants were done on the basis of reporter gene expression or germ-line transmission, making it difficult to discern vertebrate integration preferences. Here, we compare over 1300 Ds transposon integration sites in zebrafish with Tol2 transposon and retroviral integration sites. Genome-wide analysis shows that Ds integration sites in the presence or absence of marker selection are remarkably similar and distributed throughout the genome. No strict motif was found, but a preference for structural features in the target DNA associated with DNA flexibility (Twist, Tilt, Rise, Roll, Shift, and Slide) was observed. Remarkably, this feature is also found in transposon and retroviral integrations in maize and mouse cells. Our findings show that structural features influence the integration of heterologous DNA in genomes, and have implications for targeted genome engineering.",

Recent studies link a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette, sub-family C, member 11 gene (ABCC11) to the production of different types of axillary odorants and cerumen. ABCC11 encodes an ATP-driven efflux pump protein that plays an important function in ceruminous apocrine glands of the auditory canal and the secretion of axillary odor precursors. The type of cerumen and underarm odor produced by East Asians differ markedly from that produced by non-Asians. In this initial report we find that both groups emit many of the same VOCs but differ significantly in the amounts produced. The principal odorants are volatile organic C2-to-C6 acids. The physical appearance of cerumen from the two groups also matches previously reported ethnic differences, viz., cerumen from East Asians appears dry and white while that from non-Asians is typically wet and yellowish-brown.",

Employing gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) we have identified the nature and relative abundance of cerumen VOCs from 32 male donors.

In six of the seven compounds whose detected concentrations were found to be statistically different across groups, individuals of African descent (AfD) > Caucasian descent (CaD) > Asians descent (AsD).

Serological tests for other infections were all negative except SFTS virus polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) as positive from serum, bone marrow, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and liver biopsy specimen. A definitive diagnosis was SFTS-associated HLH. During 2 weeks of conservative treatment, he succeeded in recovery from multiple organ failure.

The seroprevalence of SFTS virus in farmers has not been investigated. The current knowledge of SFTS virus seroprevalence in animals, especially in wild animals, is still poor. OBJECTIVES: To investigate SFTS virus seroprevalence among farmers and a variety of animal species. STUDY DESIGN: SFTS virus antibodies in sera were determined using a double-antigen sandwich ELISA. Serum samples were collected from 2547 farmers and 2741 animals in 6 SFTS-endemic counties from March 2012 to February 2013 in Jiangsu province. The farmer participants aged from 15 to 90 years. All of them were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The animals sampled included 6 domesticated animal species and 2 wild animal species. RESULTS: SFTSV antibodies were found in a total of 33 farmers (1.30%) and was more prevalent in males than in females (respectively 1.87% and 0.71%, P<0.01). The mean age of seropositive farmers was 56.5 years and seroprevalence increased gradually with age.

Genetic mapping studies reveal that mutations in cohesion pathways are responsible for multispectrum developmental abnormalities termed cohesinopathies.

The cohesinopathies are characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities, limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells, which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes. We highlight numerous studies that illustrate the utility of zebrafish to provide novel insights into the phenotypes, genes affected and the possible mechanisms underlying cohesinopathies.

CdLS arises due to autosomal dominant mutations or haploinsufficiencies in cohesin subunits (,  and ) or cohesin auxiliary factors ( and ) that result in transcriptional dysregulation of developmental programs. RBS arises due to autosomal recessive mutations in cohesin auxiliary factor , the gene that encodes an N-acetyltransferase which targets the SMC3 subunit of the cohesin complex.

Previous findings in the zebrafish regenerating fin, however, suggest that Esco2knockdown results in transcription dysregulation, independent of apoptosis, similar to that observed in CdLS patients. Previously, we used the clinically relevant  to demonstrate a transcriptional role for Esco2.  is a gap junction gene conserved among all vertebrates that is required for direct cell-cell communication between adjacent cells such that  mutations result in oculodentodigital dysplasia. Here, we show that morpholino-mediated knockdown of  reduces  expression and perturbs zebrafish bone and tissue regeneration similar to those previously reported for  knockdown. Also similar to Esco2-dependent phenotypes, Smc3-dependent bone and tissue regeneration defects are rescued by transgenic Cx43 overexpression, suggesting that Smc3 and Esco2 cooperatively act to regulate cx43 transcription. In support of this model, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal that Smc3 binds to a discrete region of the  promoter, suggesting that Esco2 exerts transcriptional regulation of  through modification of Smc3 bound to the  promoter. These findings have the potential to unify RBS and CdLS as transcription-based mechanisms.",

BACKGROUND: Roberts syndrome (RBS) is a human developmental disorder caused by mutations in the cohesin acetyltransferase ESCO2. We previously reported that mTORC1 signaling was depressed and overall translation was reduced in RBS cells and zebrafish models for RBS. Treatment of RBS cells and zebrafish RBS models with L-leucine partially rescued mTOR function and protein synthesis, correlating with increased cell division and improved development. RESULTS: In this study, we use RBS cells to model mTORC1 repression and analyze transcription and translation with ribosome profiling to determine gene-level effects of L-leucine. L-leucine treatment partially rescued translational efficiency of ribosomal subunits, translation initiation factors, snoRNA production, and mitochondrial function in RBS cells, consistent with these processes being mTORC1 controlled. In contrast, other genes are differentially expressed independent of L-leucine treatment, including imprinted genes such as H19 and GTL2, miRNAs regulated by GTL2, HOX genes, and genes in nucleolar associated domains. CONCLUSIONS: Our study distinguishes between gene expression changes in RBS cells that are TOR dependent and those that are independent. Some of the TOR independent gene expression changes likely reflect the architectural role of cohesin in chromatin looping and gene expression. This study reveals the dramatic rescue effects of L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1 in RBS cells and supports that normal gene expression and translation requires ESCO2 function.",

Sister chromatid cohesion, mediated by cohesin complex and established by the acetyltransferases Esco1 and Esco2, is essential for faithful chromosome segregation. Mutations in Esco2 cause Roberts syndrome, a developmental disease characterized by severe prenatal retardation as well as limb and facial abnormalities. However, its exact roles during oocyte meiosis have not clearly defined. Here, we report that Esco2 localizes to the chromosomes during oocyte meiotic maturation. Depletion of Esco2 by morpholino microinjection leads to the precocious polar body extrusion, the escape of metaphase I arrest induced by nocodazole treatment and the loss of BubR1 from kinetochores, indicative of inactivated SAC. Furthermore, depletion of Esco2 causes a severely impaired spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, accompanied by the remarkably elevated incidence of defective kinetochore-microtubule attachments which consequently lead to the generation of aneuploid eggs. Notably, we find that the involvement of Esco2 in SAC and kinetochore functions is mediated by its binding to histone H4 and acetylation of H4K16 both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, our data assign a novel meiotic function to Esco2 beyond its role in the cohesion establishment during mouse oocyte meiosis.",

Tremendous effort has been expended over the past two and a half decades to understand many aspects of camelid heavy chain antibodies, from their biology, evolution, and immunogenetics to their potential applications in various fields of research and medicine. In this article, I present a historical perspective on the development of camelid single-domain antibodies (sdAbs or VHs, also widely known as nanobodies) since their discovery and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these unique molecules in various areas of research, industry, and medicine. Commercialization of camelid sdAbs exploded in 2001 with a flurry of patents issued to the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and later taken on by the Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB) and, after 2002, the VIB-founded spin-off company, Ablynx. While entrepreneurial spirit has certainly catalyzed the exploration of nanobodies as marketable products, IP restrictions may be partially responsible for the relatively long time span between the discovery of these biomolecules and their entry into the pharmaceutical market. It is now anticipated that the first VH-based antibody drug, Caplacizumab, a bivalent anti-vWF antibody for treating rare blood clotting disorders, may be approved and commercialized in 2018 or shortly thereafter.

Essentials Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) is linked with significant morbidity/mortality. Caplacizumab's effect on major thromboembolic (TE) events, exacerbations and death was studied. Fewer caplacizumab-treated patients had a major TE event, an exacerbation, or died versus placebo. Caplacizumab has the potential to reduce the acute morbidity and mortality associated with aTTP. SUMMARY: Background Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) is a life-threatening autoimmune thrombotic microangiopathy. In spite of treatment with plasma exchange and immunosuppression, patients remain at risk for thrombotic complications, exacerbations, and death. In the phase II TITAN study, treatment with caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor Nanobody was shown to reduce the time to confirmed platelet count normalization and exacerbations during treatment. Objective The clinical benefit of caplacizumab was further investigated in a post hoc analysis of the incidence of major thromboembolic events and exacerbations during the study drug treatment period and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-related death during the study. Methods The Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query (SMQ) for 'embolic and thrombotic events' was run to investigate the occurrence of major thromboembolic events and exacerbations in the safety population of the TITAN study, which consisted of 72 patients, of whom 35 received caplacizumab and 37 received placebo. Results Four events (one pulmonary embolism and three aTTP exacerbations) were reported in four patients in the caplacizumab group, and 20 such events were reported in 14 patients in the placebo group (two acute myocardial infarctions, one ischemic stroke, one hemorrhagic stroke, one pulmonary embolism, one deep vein thrombosis, one venous thrombosis, and 13 aTTP exacerbations). Two of the placebo-treated patients died from aTTP during the study. Conclusion In total, 11.4% of caplacizumab-treated patients and 43.2% of placebo-treated patients experienced one or more major thromboembolic events, experienced an exacerbation, or died. This analysis shows the potential for caplacizumab to reduce the risk of major thromboembolic morbidities and mortality associated with aTTP.",

The pesticide rotenone has been shown to cause systemic inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity, with consequent degeneration of dopamine neurons along the nigrostriatal pathway, as observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, intracranial infusion of rotenone was found to increase the protein levels of the Lewy body constituents, \u03b1-synuclein and small ubiquitin-related modifier-1(SUMO-1), in the lesioned hemisphere of the mouse brain. These findings are supportive of a mouse model of PD, but information about the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), an essential marker of dopaminergic status, was not reported. Clarification of this issue is important because an intracranial rotenone mouse model of Parkinson's disease has not been established. Towards this end, the present study examined the effects of intracranial rotenone treatment on TH and \u03b1-synuclein immunohistochemistry in addition to forelimb motor function. Mice were unilaterally infused with either vehicle or rotenone (2\u03bcg/site) in both the medial forebrain bundle and the substantia nigra. The forelimb asymmetry (cylinder) test indicated a significant decrease in use of the contralateral forelimb in lesioned animals as compared to the sham group. Densitometric analysis revealed a significant depletion of TH immunofluorescence within the ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra of lesioned animals. Moreover, a significant bilateral increase in \u03b1-synuclein immunofluorescence was found in the substantia nigra of lesioned mice, as compared to control animals.

It took almost 100 years before a meaningful advance occurred in any basic science understanding of Parkinson disease (PD) following James Parkinson's description in 1817. The Lewy body was described in 1912, and the substantia nigra was found to be depigmented with neuronal loss and gliosis in 1919. The link between dopamine and PD began in 1957, 140 years after Parkinson's Essay. Arvid Carlsson and Oleh Hornykiewicz were the major pioneers. The revolutionary therapeutic breakthrough was the introduction of high dosage levodopa therapy by George Cotzias in 1967. Following 40 years of the dopa/dopamine era, we have entered the era of alpha-synuclein, the protein present in Lewy bodies. Heiko Braak found that alpha-synuclein accumulates initially in the olfactory system and lower brainstem and then travels in an anatomic pattern to involve other regions of the brain and thereby cause progressive symptoms. Alpha-synuclein was somehow converted to a rogue protein. Where this originates and how it is propagated are under intense investigation. At the same time that the alpha-synuclein era was developing, clinical advances took place by recognizing PD as hosting a wide variety of nonmotor features with eventual cognitive impairment in many. Therapeutics has also evolved. Although the most effective therapy for the motor features remains levodopa, surgical approaches and drugs for nonmotor problems continue to expand our ability to treat people with PD. We can expect therapeutic advances in neuroprotection as the basic science discoveries uncovered in the alpha-synuclein era are translated into effective treatments.",

Several pathologic processes can produce this syndrome, but neurodegeneration accompanied by neuronal inclusions composed of \u03b1-synuclein (Lewy bodies) is considered the typical pathologic correlate of PD. METHODS: The neuropathologic features of PD are reviewed based upon personal experience and review of the literature. Molecular pathology of PD is summarized from cell biological and animal studies. RESULTS: The pathologic feature that correlates with signs and symptoms of PD is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra with dopaminergic denervation of the striatum. Neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra preferentially affects the ventrolateral cell group that projects to posterolateral putamen and is accompanied by formation of Lewy bodies composed of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein. Some patients with PD are found at autopsy to have other pathologic processes, such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and cerebrovascular disease (vascular Parkinsonism). The peripheral autonomic nervous system is also affected. The triggering event in PD is unknown, but recent studies suggest a role for loss of nuclear membrane integrity. Once \u03b1-synuclein aggregates forms, evidence supports cell-to-cell propagation.

Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data. Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.",

Controlled thermal damage to the tumor may have the same impact in DTA-HGGs. We report our multicenter results of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) in DTA-HGGs. We retrospectively reviewed 34 consecutive DTA-HGG patients (24 glioblastoma, 10 anaplastic) who underwent LITT at Cleveland Clinic, Washington University, and Wake Forest University (May 2011-December 2012) using the NeuroBlate(\u00ae) System. The extent of thermal damage was determined using thermal damage threshold (TDT) lines: yellow TDT line (43 \u00b0C for 2 min) and blue TDT line (43\u00b0C for 10 min). Volumetric analysis was performed to determine the extent-of-coverage of tumor volume by TDT lines. Patient outcomes were evaluated statistically. LITT was delivered as upfront in 19 and delivered as salvage in 16 cases. After 7.2 months of follow-up, 71% of cases demonstrated progression and 34% died.

Thirteen cases who met the following two criteria-(1) <0.05 cm(3) tumor volume not covered by the yellow TDT line and (2) <1.5 cm(3) additional tumor volume not covered by the blue TDT line-had better PFS than the other 21 cases (9.7 vs. 4.6 months; P = 0.02). LITT can be used effectively for treatment of DTA-HGGs. More complete coverage of tumor by TDT lines improves PFS which can be translated as the extent of resection concept for surgery.",

INTRODUCTION: We describe the feasibility of using minimally invasive robotic laser interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) for achieving an anterior two-thirds\u00a0as well as a complete corpus callosotomy. METHODS: Ten probe trajectories were plotted on normal magentic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using the Brainlab Stereotactic Planning Software (Brainlab, Munich, Germany). The NeuroBlate\u00ae System (Monteris Medical, MN, USA) was used to conform the thermal burn to the corpus callosum along the trajectory of the probe. The distance of the ideal entry site from either the coronal suture and the torcula or nasion and the midline was calculated. The distance of the probe tip from the dorsal and ventral limits of the callosotomy in the sagittal plane were also calculated. RESULTS: Anterior two-thirds callosotomy was possible in all patients using a posterior parieto-occipital paramedian trajectory through the non-dominant lobe.\u00a0The average entry point was 3.64 cm from the midline, 10.6 cm behind the coronal suture, and 9.2 cm above the torcula.\u00a0The probe tip was an average of 1.4 cm from the anterior commissure. For a total callosotomy, an additional contralaterally placed frontal probe was used to target the posterior one-third\u00a0of the corpus callosum. The average entry site was 3.3 cm from the midline and 9.1 cm above the nasion. The average distance of the probe tip from the base of the splenium was 0.94 cm. CONCLUSION: The directional thermoablation capability of the NeuroBlate\u00ae system\u00a0allows for targeted lesioning of the corpus callosum, to achieve a two-thirds or complete corpus callosotomy. A laser distance of < 2 cm is sufficient to reach the entire corpus callosum through one trajectory for an anterior two-thirds callosotomy\u00a0and two trajectories for a complete callosotomy.",

OBJECT: Laser interstitial thermal therapy has been used as an ablative treatment for glioma; however, its development was limited due to technical issues. The NeuroBlate System incorporates several technological advances to overcome these drawbacks. The authors report a Phase I, thermal dose-escalation trial assessing the safety and efficacy of NeuroBlate in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (rGBM). METHODS: Adults with suspected supratentorial rGBM of 15- to 40-mm dimension and a Karnofsky Performance Status score of \u2265 60 were eligible. After confirmatory biopsy, treatment was delivered using a rigid, gas-cooled, side-firing laser probe. Treatment was monitored using real-time MRI thermometry, and proprietary software providing predictive thermal damage feedback was used by the surgeon, along with control of probe rotation and depth, to tailor tissue coagulation. An external data safety monitoring board determined if toxicity at lower levels justified dose escalation. RESULTS: Ten patients were treated at the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals-Case Medical Center). Their average age was 55 years (range 34-69 years) and the median preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status score was 80 (range 70-90). The mean tumor volume was 6.8 \u00b1 5 cm(3) (range 2.6-19 cm(3)), the percentage of tumor treated was 78% \u00b1 12% (range 57%-90%), and the conformality index was 1.21 \u00b1 0.33 (range 1.00-2.04). Treatment-related necrosis was evident on MRI studies at 24 and 48 hours. The median survival was 316 days (range 62-767 days). Three patients improved neurologically, 6 remained stable, and 1 worsened. Steroid-responsive treatment-related edema occurred in all patients but one.

For ohnolog pairs that remain duplicated in two species there is a strong tendency for the faster-evolving copy in one species to be orthologous to the faster copy in the other species, which indicates that the evolutionary rate differences were established before speciation and hence soon after the WGD. We also present evidence that in cases where one ohnolog has been lost from the genome of a post-WGD species, the lost copy was likely to have been the faster-evolving member of the pair prior to its loss.

The two genomes subsequently converged onto similar current sizes (5,600 protein-coding genes each) and independently retained sets of duplicated genes that are strikingly similar. Almost half of their surviving single-copy genes are not orthologs but paralogs formed by WGD, as would be expected if most gene pairs were resolved independently. In addition, by comparing the pattern of gene loss among K. polysporus, S. cerevisiae, and three other yeasts that diverged after the WGD, we show that the patterns of gene loss changed over time. Initially, both members of a duplicate pair were equally likely to be lost, but loss of the same gene copy in independent lineages was increasingly favored at later time points. This trend parallels an increasing restriction of reciprocal gene loss to more slowly evolving gene pairs over time and suggests that, as duplicate genes diverged, one gene copy became favored over the other. The apparent low initial sequence divergence of the gene pairs leads us to propose that the yeast WGD was probably an autopolyploidization.",

Gene duplication is a key mechanism in evolution for generating new functionality, and it is known to have produced a large proportion of genes. Duplication mechanisms include small-scale, or \"local\", events such as unequal crossing over and retroposition, together with global events, such as chromosomal or whole genome duplication (WGD). In particular, different studies confirmed that the yeast S. cerevisiae arose from a 100-150 million-year old whole-genome duplication. Detection and study of duplications are usually based on sequence alignment, synteny and phylogenetic techniques, but protein domains are also useful in assessing protein homology. We develop a simple and computationally efficient protein domain architecture comparison method based on the domain assignments available from public databases. We test the accuracy and the reliability of this method in detecting instances of gene duplication in the yeast S. cerevisiae. In particular, we analyze the evolution of WGD and non-WGD paralogs from the domain viewpoint, in comparison with a more standard functional analysis of the genes. A large number of domains is shared by genes that underwent local and global duplications, indicating the existence of a common set of \"duplicable\" domains. On the other hand, WGD and non-WGD paralogs tend to have different functions. We find evidence that this comes from functional migration within similar domain superfamilies, but also from the existence of small sets of WGD and non-WGD specific domain superfamilies with largely different functions. This observation gives a novel perspective on the finding that WGD paralogs tend to be functionally different from small-scale paralogs. WGD and non-WGD superfamilies carry distinct functions. Finally, the Gene Ontology similarity of paralogs tends to decrease with duplication age, while this tendency is weaker or not observable by the comparison of the domain architectures of paralogs. This suggests that the set of domains composing a protein tends to be maintained, while its function, cellular process or localization diversifies. Overall, the gathered evidence gives a different viewpoint on the biological specificity of the WGD and at the same time points out the validity of domain architecture comparison as a tool for detecting homology.",

It measures depth from BAM or CRAM files at either each nucleotide position in a genome or for sets of genomic regions. Genomic regions may be specified as either a BED file to evaluate coverage across capture regions, or as a fixed-size window as required for copy-number calling. Mosdepth uses a simple algorithm that is computationally efficient and enables it to quickly produce coverage summaries. We demonstrate that mosdepth is faster than existing tools and provides flexibility in the types of coverage profiles produced.

The oral microbial community (microbiota) plays a critical role in human health and disease. Alterations in the oral microbiota may be associated with disorders such as gingivitis, periodontitis, childhood caries, alveolar osteitis, oral candidiasis and endodontic infections. In the immunosuppressed population, the spectrum of potential oral disease is even broader, encompassing candidiasis, necrotizing gingivitis, parotid gland enlargement, Kaposi's sarcoma, oral warts and other diseases. Here, we used 454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to examine the oral microbiome of saliva, mucosal and tooth samples from HIV-positive and negative children. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were collected from a cross-section of patients undergoing routine dental care. Multiple specimens from different sampling sites in the mouth were collected for each patient. The goal of the study was to observe the potential diversity of the oral microbiota among individual patients, sample locations, HIV status and various dental characteristics. We found that there were significant differences in the microbiome among the enrolled patients, and between sampling locations. The analysis was complicated by uneven enrollment in the patient cohorts, with only five HIV-negative patients enrolled in the study and by the rapid improvement in the health of HIV-infected children between the time the study was conceived and completed. The generally good oral health of the HIV-negative patients limited the number of dental plaque samples that could be collected. We did not identify significant differences between well-controlled HIV-positive patients and HIV-negative controls, suggesting that well-controlled HIV-positive patients essentially harbor similar oral flora compared to patients without HIV. Nor were significant differences in the oral microbiota identified between different teeth or with different dental characteristics. Additional studies are needed to better characterize the oral microbiome in children and those with poorly-controlled HIV infections.",

Differentiation of Nanog-KD epiblasts demonstrated requirement for Nanog in stabilization of pluripotency. Nanog expression in epiblast is directly regulated by Nodal/Smad2 pathway in a visceral endoderm-dependent manner. Notably, Nanog promoters switch from Oct4/Esrrb in ICM/ESCs to Oct4/Smad2 in epiblasts. Smad2 directly associates with Oct4 to form Nanog promoting protein complex.

We used a genome-wide short hairpin RNA screen in mouse ES cells to identify genes that are essential for initiation of differentiation. Knockdown of the scaffolding protein Mek binding protein 1 (Mp1, also known as Lamtor3 or Map2k1ip1) stimulated self-renewal of ES cells, blocked differentiation, and promoted proliferation. Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) signaling is required for initial fate commitment of ES cells. Knockdown of Mp1 inhibited FGF4-induced differentiation but did not alter FGF4-driven proliferation. This uncoupling of differentiation and proliferation was also observed when oncogenic Ras isoforms were overexpressed in ES cells. Knockdown of Mp1 redirected FGF4 signaling from differentiation toward pluripotency and up-regulated the pluripotency-related genes Esrrb, Rex1, Tcl1, and Sox2. We also found that human germ cell tumors (GCTs) express low amounts of Mp1 in the invasive embryonic carcinoma and seminoma histologies and higher amounts of Mp1 in the noninvasive carcinoma in situ precursor and differentiated components. Knockdown of Mp1 in invasive GCT cells resulted in resistance to differentiation, thereby showing a functional role for Mp1 both in normal differentiation of ES cells and in germ cell cancer.",

Transcription factors (TF) often bind in heterodimeric complexes with each TF recognizing a specific neighboring cis element in the regulatory region of the genome. Comprehension of this DNA motif grammar is opaque, yet recent developments have allowed the interrogation of genome-wide TF binding sites. We reasoned that within this data novel motif grammars could be identified that controlled distinct biological programs. For this purpose, we developed a novel motif-discovery tool termed fexcom that systematically interrogates ChIP-seq data to discover spatially constrained TF-TF composite motifs occurring over short DNA distances. We applied this to the extensive ChIP-seq data available from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In addition to the well-known and most prevalent sox-oct motif, we also discovered a novel constrained spacer motif for Esrrb and Sox2 with a gap of between 2 and 8 bps that Essrb and Sox2 cobind in a selective fashion. Through the use of knockdown experiments, we argue that the Esrrb-Sox2 complex is an arbiter of gene expression differences between ESCs and epiblast stem cells (EpiSC). A number of genes downregulated upon dual Esrrb/Sox2 knockdown (e.g., Klf4, Klf5, Jam2, Pecam1) are similarly downregulated in the ESC to EpiSC transition and contain the esrrb-sox motif. The prototypical Esrrb-Sox2 target gene, containing an esrrb-sox element conserved throughout eutherian and metatherian mammals, is Nr0b1. Through positive regulation of this transcriptional repressor, we argue the Esrrb-Sox2 complex promotes the ESC state through inhibition of the EpiSC transcriptional program and the same trio may also function to maintain trophoblast stem cells.",

Self-renewal capacity and pluripotency, which are controlled by the Oct3/4-centered transcriptional regulatory network, are major characteristics of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Nuclear hormone receptor Dax1 is one of the crucial factors in the network. Here, we identified an orphan nuclear receptor, Esrrb (estrogen-related receptor beta), as a Dax1-interacting protein. Interaction of Dax1 and Esrrb was mediated through LXXLL motifs of Dax1 and the activation- and ligand-binding domains of Esrrb. Furthermore, Esrrb enhanced the promoter activity of the Dax1 gene via direct binding to Esrrb-binding site 1 (ERRE1, where \"ERRE\" represents \"Esrrb-responsive element\") of the promoter. Expression of Dax1 was suppressed followed by Oct3/4 repression; however, overexpression of Esrrb maintained expression of Dax1 even in the absence of Oct3/4, indicating that Dax1 is a direct downstream target of Esrrb and that Esrrb can regulate Dax1 expression in an Oct3/4-independent manner. We also found that the transcriptional activity of Esrrb was repressed by Dax1. Furthermore, we revealed that Oct3/4, Dax1, and Esrrb have a competitive inhibition capacity for each complex. These data, together with previous findings, suggest that Dax1 functions as a negative regulator of Esrrb and Oct3/4, and these molecules form a regulatory loop for controlling the pluripotency and self-renewal capacity of ES cells.",

Lung cancer is the leading killer of both men and women in the US, and the 5-year survival remains poor. However, the approval of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has shifted the treatment paradigm and provides hope for improved survival. The ability of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to evade the host immune system can be overcome by agents such as pembrolizumab (MK-3475/lambrolizumab), which is a monoclonal antibody targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. In early studies, treatment with pembrolizumab led to dramatic and durable responses in select patients (PD-L1+ tumors). This remarkable efficacy lead to approval of pembrolizumab in the second-line setting as response rates were almost doubled compared to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. Most recently, data in the first-line setting from the KEYNOTE-024 study have redefined the SOC therapy for a selected subset of patients. In patients with \u226550% PD-L1+ tumors, pembrolizumab had a clear progression-free survival and overall survival benefit. Toxicity was mostly immune related and similar to checkpoint blockade toxicities observed in previous studies. The initial approval and subsequent studies of pembrolizumab required and utilized a companion diagnostic test, Dako's IHC 22C3, to assess PD-L1 status of patients. The evaluation and scoring system of this assay has been used by other companies as a reference to develop their own assays, which may complicate selection of patients. Finally, the impact of pembrolizumab in NSCLC is growing as evidenced by the numerous, ongoing trials open for combinations with chemotherapy, chemoradiation, other immunotherapeutics, immunomodulators, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Further studies are also evaluating pembrolizumab in small-cell lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma.

OBJECTIVE: Endothelial cells (ECs) play an important role in neovascularisation, but are too limited in number for adequate therapeutic applications. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to differentiate into endothelial lineage cells, which makes them attractive candidates for therapeutic angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate efficient differentiation of MSCs into ECs by inducing medium in\u00a0vitro. METHODS: MSCs were isolated from bone marrow by density gradient centrifugation. The characterisation of the MSCs was determined by their cluster of differentiation (CD) marker profile. Inducing medium containing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin like growth factor (IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), ascorbic acid, and heparin was applied to differentiate the MSCs into ECs. Endothelial differentiation was quantitatively evaluated using flow cytometry. Real time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyse mRNA expression of endothelial markers. Tube formation assay was further performed to examine the functional status of the differentiated MSCs. RESULTS: Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that CD31 and CD34 cells increased steadily from 12% at 3 days, to 40% at 7 days, and to 60% at 14 days. Immunofluorescence staining further confirmed the expression of CD31 and CD34. qRT-PCR showed that expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF), vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) were significantly higher in the induced MSCs group compared with the uninduced MSCs group. The functional behavior of the differentiated cells was tested by tube formation assay in\u00a0vitro on matrigel. Induced MSCs were capable of developing capillary networks, and progressive formation of vessel like structures was associated with increased EC population.

BACKGROUND: No systemic therapies have been approved for the treatment of advanced cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma. This cancer may be responsive to immune therapy, because the mutation burden of the tumor is high and the disease risk is strongly associated with immunosuppression. In the dose-escalation portion of the phase 1 study of cemiplimab, a deep and durable response was observed in a patient with metastatic cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma. METHODS: We report the results of the phase 1 study of cemiplimab for expansion cohorts of patients with locally advanced or metastatic cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, as well as the results of the pivotal phase 2 study for a cohort of patients with metastatic disease (metastatic-disease cohort). In both studies, the patients received an intravenous dose of cemiplimab (3 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 2 weeks and were assessed for a response every 8 weeks. In the phase 2 study, the primary end point was the response rate, as assessed by independent central review. RESULTS: In the expansion cohorts of the phase 1 study, a response to cemiplimab was observed in 13 of 26 patients (50%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 30 to 70). In the metastatic-disease cohort of the phase 2 study, a response was observed in 28 of 59 patients (47%; 95% CI, 34 to 61). The median follow-up was 7.9 months in the metastatic-disease cohort of the phase 2 study. Among the 28 patients who had a response, the duration of response exceeded 6 months in 57%, and 82% continued to have a response and to receive cemiplimab at the time of data cutoff. Adverse events that occurred in at least 15% of the patients in the metastatic-disease cohort of the phase 2 study were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, constipation, and rash; 7% of the patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, cemiplimab induced a response in approximately half the patients and was associated with adverse events that usually occur with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

The enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 (IDO-2) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO-2) initiate the first step of the KP.

Here, we report the first comprehensive characterisation of the KP in 1) cultured human glioma cells and 2) plasma from patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Our data revealed that interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) stimulation significantly potentiated the expression of the KP enzymes, IDO-1 IDO-2, kynureninase (KYNU), kynurenine hydroxylase (KMO) and significantly down-regulated 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) and kynurenine aminotransferase-I (KAT-I) expression in cultured human glioma cells.

KP activation (KYN/TRP) was significantly higher, whereas the concentrations of the neuroreactive KP metabolites TRP, KYNA, QUIN and PIC and the KYNA/KYN ratio were significantly lower in GBM patient plasma (n = 18) compared to controls. These results provide further evidence for the involvement of the KP in glioma pathophysiology and highlight a potential role of KP products as novel and highly attractive therapeutic targets to evaluate for the treatment of brain tumors, aimed at restoring anti-tumor immunity and reducing the capacity for malignant cells to produce NAD(+), which is necessary for energy production and DNA repair.",

Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are lipid anchors allowing the exposure of proteins at the outer layer of the plasma membrane. In fungi, a number of GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are involved in the remodeling of the cell wall polymers. GPIs follow a specific biosynthetic pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum. After the transfer of the protein onto the GPI-anchor, a lipid remodeling occurs to substitute the diacylglycerol moiety by a ceramide. In addition to GPI-APs,  produces a GPI-anchored polysaccharide, the galactomannan (GM), that remains unique in the fungal kingdom. To investigate the role of the GPI pathway in the biosynthesis of the GM and cell wall organization, the deletion of -coding for a phospholipase required for the first step of the GPI lipid remodeling-was undertaken. Biochemical characterization of the GPI-anchor isolated from GPI-APs showed that the  deficient mutant produced a lipid anchor with a diacylglycerol. The absence of a ceramide on GPI-anchors in the  mutant led to a mislocation of GPI-APs and to an alteration of the composition of the cell wall alkali-insoluble fraction. On the other hand, the GM isolated from the  mutant membranes possesses a ceramide moiety as the parental strain, showing that GPI anchor of the GM follow a distinct unknown biosynthetic pathway.",

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring of proteins is a conserved posttranslational modification in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Soon after GPI is attached, an acyl chain on the GPI inositol is removed by post-GPI attachment to proteins 1 (PGAP1), a GPI-inositol deacylase. This is crucial for switching GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) from protein folding to transport states. We performed haploid genetic screens to identify factors regulating GPI-inositol deacylation, identifying seven genes. In particular, calnexin cycle impairment caused inefficient GPI-inositol deacylation. Calnexin was specifically associated with GPI-APs, dependent on -glycan and GPI moieties, and assisted efficient GPI-inositol deacylation by PGAP1. Under chronic ER stress caused by misfolded GPI-APs, inositol-acylated GPI-APs were exposed on the cell surface. These results indicated that -glycans participate in quality control and temporal ER retention of GPI-APs, ensuring their correct folding and GPI processing before exiting from the ER. Once the system is disrupted by ER stress, unprocessed GPI-APs become exposed on the cell surface.",

To date, the products of the PER1, GUP1 and CWH43 genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been shown to be involved in the lipid remodelling.

The O. minuta per1\u0394 mutant exhibited a more fragile phenotype than the gup1\u0394 or cwh43\u0394 mutants.

One of the major disappointments in autoimmunity has been the relative lack of informative data when genomewide associations (GWAS) have been applied to patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Indeed, there is increasing evidence that SLE is characterized by widespread epigenetic changes. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a newly discovered modified form of cytosine suspected to be an important epigenetic modification in embryonic development, cell differentiation and cancer. DNA methylation dynamics have already been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE, while little is known about hydroxymethylation in this process. Here, we show an increased 5-hmC level in genomic DNA in CD4(+) T cells of patients with SLE compared with healthy controls, accompanied by the up-regulated expression of the Ten-eleven translocation TET2 and TET3, which can enzymatically convert 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hmC. Moreover, we present the differential patterns of DNA hydroxymethylation in genome-wide promoter regions in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls. We identified 2748 genes with increased 5-hmC levels in promoter regions in SLE CD4(+) T cells, which were enriched in critical pathways, including neurotrophin signaling, WNT signaling, MAPK signaling, calcium signaling and the mTOR signaling pathway. Through a combined analysis of differential DNA hydroxymethylation profile and gene expression profile in SLE CD4(+) T cells, we found 131 genes with the increased 5-hmC in promoter regions and up-regulated expression in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls, including selected immune-related genes, i.e. SOCS1, NR2F6 and IL15RA, which were also confirmed by ChIP-qPCR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CTCF, as a transcription factor, can mediate DNA hydroxymethylation and contribute to overexpression of SOCS1 in CD4(+) T cells through binding to the promoter region of SOCS1. Taken together, our study reveals a critical differential 5-hmC in the genome-wide promoter regions of SLE CD4(+) T cells and provides a novel mechanism that suggests that DNA hydroxymethylation contributes to the aberrant regulation of genes transcription in the pathogenesis of SLE.",

Our results showed that BDH2 expression was decreased, intracellular iron was increased, global DNA hydroxymethylation level was elevated, while methylation level was reduced in lupus CD4 T cells compared with healthy controls. The decreased BDH2 contributed to DNA hyper-hydroxymethylation and hypomethylation via increasing intracellular iron in CD4 T cells, which led to overexpression of immune related genes.

Although the exact cause of SLE is still unknown, the influence of environment, which is largely reflected by the epigenetic mechanisms, with DNA methylation changes in particular, are generally considered as key players in the pathogenesis of SLE. As an important post-translational modification, DNA methylation mainly suppresses the expression of relevant genes. Accumulating evidence has indicated that abnormal DNA hypomethylation in T cells is an important epigenetic hallmark in SLE. Apart from those classic methylation-sensitive autoimmunity-related genes in lupus, such as CD11a (ITGAL), Perforin (PRF1), CD70 (TNFSF7), CD40 ligand (TNFSF5) and PP2Ac\u03b1, the genome-wide methylation pattern has also been explored recently, providing us a more and more full-scale picture of the abnormal status of DNA methylation in SLE.

Epigenetic alteration can be the net result of preceding infections, medication, diet, and/or other environmental influences. While altered DNA methylation and histone modifications had already been established as pathomechanisms, DNA hydroxymethylation was more recently identified as an activating epigenetic mark.

Several thermodynamic parameters for the reaction were determined or calculated, including the overall equilibrium constant (K(eq) = 84) and the apparent equilibrium constant of the internal step (K(int) = 4) which involves the rate-determining interconversion of central complexes. A large (100-fold) difference in Vmax accounts for nucleotide specificity (ATP vs CTP), despite an only 3-fold difference in Km. Comparison of the sulfur elemental effect on Vmax for ATP and CTP suggests that the chemical step is rate-determining for both reactions. Comparison of the sulfur elemental effect on Vmax/Km revealed differences in the mechanism by which either nucleotide is incorporated.

Studies were identified using MEDLINE and additional sources (European Society for Medical Oncology, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and World Conference on Lung Cancer abstracts) in agreement with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane guidelines. Lung toxicity was reported in 105 of 4943 NSCLC patients (2.1%). Crizotinib was responsible for pulmonary adverse events (AEs) in 1.8% of exposed patients (49 of 2706). With the limit of a lower number of treated patients (n\u00a0= 359), brigatinib resulted as the most frequently involved in lung toxicity (7%; n\u00a0= 25). Pulmonary AEs during therapy with ceritinib, alectinib, and lorlatinib occurred in 1.1%, 2.6%, and 1.8% of the patients, respectively.

The United Nations Millennium Development Goal of reversing the global spread of tuberculosis by 2015 has been offset by the rampant re-emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis, in particular fluoroquinolone-resistant multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. After decades of quiescence in the development of antituberculosis medications, bedaquiline and delamanid have been conditionally approved for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis, while several other novel compounds (AZD5847, PA-824, SQ109 and sutezolid) have been evaluated in phase II clinical trials. Before novel drugs can find their place in the battle against drug-resistant tuberculosis, linezolid has been compassionately used with success in the treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. This review largely discusses six novel drugs that have been evaluated in phase II and III clinical trials, with focus on the clinical evidence for efficacy and safety, potential drug interactions, and prospect for using multiple novel drugs in new regimens.",

OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed to determine whether trefoil factor family (TFF) peptides which were generally considered to be resistant to proteolysis could be digested by gingipains, a major proteinases produced by Porphyromonas gingivalis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recombinant human TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3 peptides were used as substrates. Gingipains including arginine gingipain (RgpB) and lysine gingipain (Kgp) were used as enzymes. Trypsin was used as a control protease. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with time-of-flight / time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were used for analyzing peptide mass signals and amino acid sequences of digested TFF peptides. RESULTS: MALDI-TOF/TOF analyses demonstrated that Kgp, RgpB, and trypsin were able to cleave TFF1 and TFF2 peptides, resulting in different patterns of digested fragments. However, impurity in recombinant TFF3 peptide substrates affected the interpretations of enzymatic reaction by MALDI-TOF/TOF. LC-MS analyses demonstrated that identified fragments of TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3 from digestion by gingipains were similar to those by trypsin. CONCLUSIONS: Using MALDI-TOF/TOF and LC-MS, the present study provides new information that gingipains containing trypsin-like activities are able to digest TFF peptides. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The proteolytic effects of gingipains on TFF peptides may be responsible for reduction of salivary TFF peptides in chronic periodontitis patients. Further investigations to determine the pathological effects of gingipains on TFF peptides in saliva and periodontal tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis would be of interest.",

Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone periodontal pathogen that has been associated with autoimmune disorders. The cell surface proteases Lys-gingipain (Kgp) and Arg-gingipains (RgpA and RgpB) are major virulence factors, and their proteolytic activity is enhanced by small peptides such as glycylglycine (GlyGly). The reaction kinetics suggested that GlyGly may function as an acceptor molecule for gingipain-catalyzed transpeptidation. Purified gingipains and P. gingivalis whole cells were used to digest selected substrates including human hemoglobin in the presence or absence of peptide acceptors. Mass spectrometric analysis of the substrates digested with gingipains in the presence of GlyGly showed that transpeptidation outcompeted hydrolysis, whereas the trypsin-digested controls exhibited predominantly hydrolysis activity. The transpeptidation levels increased with increasing concentration of GlyGly. Purified gingipains and whole cells exhibited extensive transpeptidation activities on human hemoglobin. All hemoglobin cleavage sites were found to be suitable for GlyGly transpeptidation, and this transpeptidation enhanced hemoglobin digestion. The transpeptidation products were often more abundant than the corresponding hydrolysis products. In the absence of GlyGly, hemoglobin peptides produced during digestion were utilized as acceptors leading to the detection of up to 116 different transpeptidation products in a single reaction. P. gingivalis cells were able to digest hemoglobin faster when acceptor peptides derived from human serum albumin were included in the reaction, suggesting that gingipain-catalyzed transpeptidation may be relevant for substrates encountered in vivo. The transpeptidation of host proteins in vivo may potentially lead to the breakdown of immunological tolerance, culminating in autoimmune reactions.",

Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative black pigmenting anaerobe that is unable to synthesize heme [Fe(II)-protoporphyrin IX] or hemin [Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX-Cl], which are important growth/virulence factors, and must therefore derive them from the host. Porphyromonas gingivalis expresses several proteinaceous hemin-binding sites, which are important in the binding/transport of heme/hemin from the host. It also synthesizes several virulence factors, namely cysteine-proteases Arg- and Lys-gingipains and two lipopolysaccharides (LPS), O-LPS and A-LPS. The gingipains are required for the production of the black pigment, \u03bc-oxo-bisheme {[Fe(III)PPIX] O}, which is derived from hemoglobin and deposited on the bacterial cell-surface leading to the characteristic black colonies when grown on blood agar. In this study we investigated the role of LPS in the deposition of \u03bc-oxo-bisheme on the cell-surface. A P.\u00a0gingivalis mutant defective in the biosynthesis of Arg-gingipains, namely rgpA/rgpB, produces brown colonies on blood agar and mutants defective in Lys-gingipain (kgp) and LPS biosynthesis namely porR, waaL, wzy, and pg0129 (\u03b1-1, 3-mannosyltransferase) produce non-pigmented colonies. However, only those mutants lacking A-LPS showed reduced hemin-binding when cells in suspension were incubated with hemin. Using native, de-O-phosphorylated and de-lipidated LPS from P.\u00a0gingivalis W50 and porR strains, we demonstrated that hemin-binding to O-polysaccharide (PS) and to the lipid A moiety of LPS was reduced compared with hemin-binding to A-PS. We conclude that A-LPS in the outer-membrane of P.\u00a0gingivalis serves as a scaffold/anchor for the retention of \u03bc-oxo-bisheme on the cell surface and pigmentation is dependent on the presence of A-LPS.",

In spite of consistent efforts being made, the disease has not been curtailed yet.

The current situation clearly manifests the need to discover and develop new potent molecules/approaches that could help to tackle drug resistance. Various molecules, such as derivatives of fluoroquinolones (e.g. gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin and DC-159a), rifamycins (rifapentine), oxazolidinones (linezolid, sutezolid/PNU-100480), diarylquinolines (TMC207/bedaquiline), antifungal azoles, pyrrole (LL3858), nitroimidazopyran (PA824), nitroimidazole (OPC67683, TBA-354), diamine (SQ109) and benzothiazinone (BTZ043) are being developed in an attempt to combat the disease. This review presents a general introduction to the current status of the disease, the biology of the pathogen as well as the state of drug development against tuberculosis (TB) with emphasis on the major problems and bottlenecks associated with the same. Starting from the first drug against TB, the review discusses the entire history and the course of development of the drugs which are available today in the market as well as those which are under various phases of clinical and pre-clinical trials along with their mechanism of action.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the major cause of nonrelapse morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Prevention and treatment of GVHD remain inadequate and commonly lead to end-organ dysfunction and opportunistic infection. The role of interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 in GVHD remains uncertain, due to an apparent lack of lineage fidelity and variable and contextually determined protective and pathogenic effects. We demonstrate that donor T cell-derived IL-22 significantly exacerbates cutaneous chronic GVHD and that IL-22 is produced by highly inflammatory donor CD4 T cells posttransplantation. IL-22 and IL-17A derive from both independent and overlapping lineages, defined as T helper (Th)22 and IL-22 Th17 cells. Donor Th22 and IL-22 Th17 cells share a similar IL-6-dependent developmental pathway, and while Th22 cells arise independently of the IL-22 Th17 lineage, IL-17 signaling to donor Th22 directly promotes their development in allo-SCT. Importantly, while both IL-22 and IL-17 mediate skin GVHD, Th17-induced chronic GVHD can be attenuated by IL-22 inhibition in preclinical systems. In the clinic, high levels of both IL-17A and IL-22 expression are present in the skin of patients with GVHD after allo-SCT. Together, these data demonstrate a key role for donor-derived IL-22 in patients with chronic skin GVHD and confirm parallel but symbiotic developmental pathways of Th22 and Th17 differentiation.",

Millions of children are affected by different neurodevelopmental disorders, out of which autism spectrum disorder (ASD) poses a major hurdle to normal life style due to associated behavioral abnormalities. Several studies have shown an increased expression/release of Th17 related cytokine, IL-17A in ASD. IL-17A may enhance neuroinflammation via its IL-17A receptor, i.e. IL-17RA expressed in immune cells (such as monocytes) of autistic children. Increased oxidative stress has been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. However, whether IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling contributes to oxidative inflammation in monocytes of autistic children has not been explored previously. With this background, we performed this study in peripheral monocytes of ASD patients and age-matched typically developing children. Our study shows that ASD individuals have increased IL-17RA expression in monocytes which is associated with increased nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u03baB) pathway and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/nitrotyrosine expression as compared to typically developing children. Moreover, in vitro activation of IL-17 receptor by IL-17A in monocytes isolated from ASD individuals leads to enhanced iNOS expression via NF\u03baB pathway. IL-17RA antibody treatment in vitro reversed IL-17A-induced increase in NF\u03baB and iNOS/nitrotyrosine expression in monocytes isolated from ASD subjects. These data connect increased IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling in ASD patients with enhanced oxidative inflammation in monocytes. Therefore, IL-17 receptor signaling in monocytes may potentiate the effects of IL-17A released by other immune cells and may aggravate neuroinflammation in ASD. Our study further suggests that blockade of IL-17A/IL-17 receptor signaling may be beneficial in the children with ASD.",

During inflammation lymphatic vessels (LVs) are enlarged and their density is increased to facilitate the migration of activated immune cells and antigens.

Here we show that interleukin (IL)-17A, secreted from T helper type 17 (T17) cells, is a negative regulator of lymphangiogenesis during the resolution phase of T17-mediated immune responses. Moreover, IL-17A suppresses the expression of major lymphatic markers in lymphatic endothelial cells and decreases in vitro LV formation. To investigate the role of IL-17A in vivo, we utilized a cholera toxin-mediated inflammation model and identified inflammation and resolution phases based on the numbers of recruited immune cells. IL-17A, markedly produced by T17 cells even after the peak of inflammation, was found to participate in the negative regulation of LV formation. Moreover, blockade of IL-17A resulted in not only increased density of LVs in tissues but also their enhanced function. Taken together, these findings improve the current understanding of the relationship between LVs and inflammatory cytokines in pathologic conditions.",
